In the initial file less number of rounds of analysis is done so the algorithm 
was not able find the best one yet, sometimes it may find wrong best. So optimum 
number of rounds of anlysis has to done to find the best. In the UCB1.ipynb file
more rounds are used, further increase in rounds of analysis will result in the 
same output.
   The optimum number of rounds of analysis is differs from problem to problem
